"You’re beautiful, you’re perfect, you’re everything I ever wanted!..But I can’t figure out why you would want a one-eyed bum like me..."
--
"You’re not other women, sweetness. You see, other women, I could love and leave...but if I love you, I don’t think I'd be able to leave".
--
Kayla: How do I look?   Steve: Like the most beautiful woman I’ve ever seen in my life.
--
Steve: What do you see in me?   Kayla: Boy, you...you really dive right in, don’t you...I mean at slumber parties we usually wait ’til midnight....   Steve: Well, you haven’t been to the slumber parties I go to, baby. At those parties you don’t ask questions....come on...we got a plane to catch.   Kayla: ....I see a man I would trust with my life...I don’t care what you say, Steve, or how flip you want to be about it. I see someone who has a very, very good soul. I also see someone who has been burned so many times in his life he’s afraid to get close to the fire.
--
"I care about you Steve...I care about you a lot, and you are making a big mistake turning your back on me, because I am the best thing that ever happened to you!"
--
"You know, the last few days all I could think about was Roman and Marlena and of how happy they always were...now Roman’s alone. But nothing can ever take away that wonderful time they spent together. And all of a sudden I realized...maybe once in your whole life something really special like that comes along...and then, poof, out of nowhere it’s just gone! Steve we have a shot at something really special here and I don’t think we should just throw it away...I think that’s stupid and I just don’t want to do it!"
--
"I care about you Kayla... and I want you!"
--
Steve: What kind of a weird fantasy do you have about me, Kayla? Do you think there’s some kind of Knight in Shining Armor who is just dying to get out, is that it?   Kayla: NO! That’s not it at all...   Steve: Look at me Kayla!   Kayla: It’s not how you look, it’s how you are!   Steve: Why don’t you ask Roman and Bo and ...   Kayla: I don’t care about Roman! I don’t care about Bo!...I thought I made that clear in Stockholm. I have a mind of my own and a heart of my own and I will give my heart to whoever I want!
--
"I remember I was in that hotel room with Hope, had that bullet in my shoulder. I didn’t know she’d called you. I guess it was the next day...I’ll never forget that door flying open and you standing there. I was never so happy to see anyone in my whole life"
--
Kayla: How can you do this?   Steve: What am I doing?   Kayla: You’re pushing me away again..   Steve: No, I’m not...   Kayla: What does it take to get close to you?   Steve: I’ve let you get closer to me than anyone, ever, in my whole life...
--
Kayla: "It was wonderful"   Steve: "You know why?"   Kayla: "Why?"   Steve: "Because I love you. I love you Kayla!"
--
Kayla: "You always knew it would be like this didn’t you?"   Steve: "I did..."   Kayla: "Then why did it take you so long to want me?"   Steve: "Kayla, I’ve always wanted you...I wanted you from the first time I saw you. "
--
"I’m afraid to trust you. You used to always say I was so naive, that I was living in a fantasy. And I saw everything through rose colored glasses. But I don’t anymore. I guess I have to thank you for that. You really straightened me out on a few things. I loved you....I still love you. But no one is ever going to hurt me again the way you did. Not even you."
--
"...I never stopped loving her. We’re connected, man. No matter where we are, if one of us is in trouble, the other one knows about it. So right now you see, no matter how sick she is, somewhere in the back of her mind she’s thinking of me. She knows that I’m there for her, she’s counting on me. But I’m at a dead end. I don’t know where to go, I don’t know where to look. Marcus, man, if she dies, I die! ...."
--
Steve: "I’m not really very good with words, all I know is I love you. And we were meant to be together, forever. What do they say? Til death do us part. But you know what, I don’t think even that’s going to keep us apart..."   Kayla: "I feel the same way Steve. I feel like we’ve known each other- since before we were born...I think we were always supposed to be together. I know I’ll love you that long. And in this life, and in the next and in the next, there will always be a part of you with me, and I will always be with you."
--
Kayla: Steve!   Steve: Huh?   Kayla: I never felt how much you loved me until now....I never felt how much I love you....Steve: It’s true, I do love you. I love you more than anything, ever, in this life.
--
"Sweetness. You gotta come back to me baby. I’m having a hard time dealing with this. Just a couple of hours ago you were talking about our wedding. Making plans. Now you just lie there. So still. Baby don’t leave me. We’ve got a lot to do. We’ve got a lot of years to be together. Yes we do! You know I used to look in the mirror. And what do you think I saw? I saw a bum! A one eyed bum. And I knew I would never amount to a hill of beans. But now when I look in the mirror I see the man Kayla loves. That makes me special....If you left I wouldn’t have any reason to go on living. Just wake up baby, c’mon just wake up! Open your eyes and look at me so I know you can hear me! I want you to hear me tell you that I love you! I want to tell you every day from now on. "
--
"I just can’t believe it. We got off to such a shaky start. You know why don’t you? Because I was afraid...I was afraid- I wouldn’t tell this to too many people...but I was afraid of love. Can you imagine that? It’s cause I never had it, I didn’t think I...I ... deserved it. But Kayla never gave up on me man...I kept pushing her away, and hurtin her ...but no matter what I did she never gave up on me. And I’m glad she didn’t. She saw somethin in me dude. And I am just about the happiest man on earth right now because of that. "
--
"I can’t believe this. I can’t believe this is gonna happen. I guess I’ve got you to thank, huh Big Dude? She thinks she gave me a lot...man I didn’t even have dreams. I thought my life was gonna be all bad. I had no idea....that I could have love. And you gave me Kayla. And now I’ve got it all. "
--
"Mr. Johnson, just for the record, I love the way you look. " "I think it’s sexy."
--
"Roses are Sweet, and so are you, because you love me, I’m a lucky dude"
--
" Listen to me. I am not going anywhere. I am going to be in that bedroom every single night, and I want you there, by my side, right next to me. Whatever is haunting you, I love the man you are NOW."
--
"You know...someday, when I’m facing ‘the Big Dude’ or whoever it is who tallies up the scores here on earth...they’re going to ask me ‘Steven Earl Johnson...what was the finest thing you ever did?’ And I’m going to say, ‘One time, I let down my guard, and I let a girl named Kayla love me’ . I don’t know if that answer is going to get me into heaven, but I don’t care. This is heaven."
